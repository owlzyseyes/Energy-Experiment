# Energy-Experiment

Investigating the impact of various fuel sources on CO2 emissions across different geographical regions. The goal is to understand which assigned fuel source contributes the most to CO2 emissions and whether this varies depending on location. 

## Dataset Source

The dataset was sourced from Datacamp.

## Project Structure

- `drug_safety.csv`: The main dataset file.
- `experiment.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis code.

## Instructions

To reproduce the analysis or contribute to the project, follow the steps outlined in the Jupyter Notebook (`experiment.ipynb`).

Feel free to explore the dataset and contribute to the enhancement of drug safety analysis.
